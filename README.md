# Gowny - Your Ultimate Wedding Dress Destination

Welcome to the Gowny project repository, the outcome of our intensive learning journey in Hacktiv8's bootcamp. Gowny is an exceptional platform that reimagines the wedding dress discovery process, offering a wealth of features to create an unforgettable experience. As a Front End Developer on this project, my focus was on crafting an immersive and user-centric interface that resonates with the significance of the occasion.

## Contents of the Repository

This repository is divided into two main sections: `Server` and `Client`.

- **Server Folder**: This segment houses the server-side code for Gowny, including server logic, APIs, database interactions, and more.
- **Client Folder**: Within this section, you'll find the client-side code, featuring interactive user interfaces, components, and client-side interactions.
